\prefacesection{Abstract}
Proteins are complex molecules with various functions that are critical to any living organism which comes in all different shapes and sizes. The shape of a protein defines its function, therefore, protein structure study is of great importance, since it can help scientists to control or modify the protein to change its function and help with various disease treatments. 

In this project, ProteinAR - an iOS application was developed. The goal of the project is to integrate technology into biology to aid with study and research by visualising protein structures and enable interactions with these structures in Augmented Reality. ProteinAR aims to download protein data and display it in real-time. RCSB PDB is the main source of protein data for this project. ProteinAR downloads protein data from RCSB when a protein ID is inputted. 

ProteinAR succeeded in visualising protein structures on AR screen and also in allowing users to interact with these structures. Using ProteinAR, users have the freedom to observe even the most complex protein structures by zooming in or rotating them by interaction with the phone screen instead of looking through a microscope. Moreover, new protein structure creation is another key function of ProteinAR. Users can combine the polypeptide chains (flex coil, rig coil, helix, sheet) to create new protein models and interact with them. 

ProteinAR was written in Swift on Xcode, a native language and IDE for iOS apps developed by Apple. ProteinAR integrated the framework ARKit for Augmented Reality functions. 

Even though further developments could be done to complete the app, ProteinAR is a successful first step in bringing the AR technology into protein visualisation and design.
