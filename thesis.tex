\prefacesection{Abstract}
Proteins are complex molecules with various functions that are critical to any living organism which comes in all different shapes and sizes. The shape of a protein defines its function, therefore, the study of protein structure is of great importance since it can help scientists to control or modify the protein to change its function and help with various disease treatments. 

In this project, ProteinAR - an iOS application was developed with the goal of aiding the field of biology by visualising protein structures and enabling interactions in Augmented Reality. While past projects looked to non-interactive digital environments for protein visualisation, with ProteinAR, users can observe on their smartphone screens simple to complex protein structures by zooming in, rotating or moving them. Users are also able to create new interactive proteins. ProteinAR was written in Swift on Xcode, a native language and IDE developed by Apple for iOS apps, and used the integrated framework ARKit for Augmented Reality functions. When a user inputs a protein ID, ProteinAR downloads protein data and displays it in real-time using RCSB PDB as the main source of protein data. Product evaluation concludes that, with further development, ProteinAR demonstrates potential for the application of augmented reality technology in protein visualisation and design, particularly for researchers, educators, and students of biology.
