One example is the ability to create enhanced 3D environments that simulate physical presence in the real worlda virtual reality. This is relevant to drug discovery since molecular models are frequently used to obtain deeper understandings of, say, ligand−protein complexes. We have developed a tool (Molecular Rift), which creates a virtual reality environment steered with hand movements. Oculus Rift, a head-mounted display, is used to create the virtual settings. The program is controlled by gesture-recognition, using the gaming sensor {MS} Kinect v2, eliminating the need for standard input devices. The Open Babel toolkit was integrated to provide access to powerful cheminformatics functions. Molecular Rift was developed with a focus on usability, including iterative test-group evaluations. We conclude with reﬂections on virtual reality’s future capabilities in chemistry and education. Molecular Rift is open source and can be downloaded from {GitHub}.},

The lack of simple, accessible, and easy-to-use teaching tools for visualizing and interacting with (i.e., rotating, translating, zooming) 3D virtual representations of macromolecular structure also continues to be a limitation for biochemistry instructors interested in incorporating more 3D visualizations in their classrooms. To address this current gap in available instructional tools, a novel app utilizing augmented reality ({AR}) technology to visualize macromolecular structures is described. The app allows users to easily visualize and manipulate the 3D structure of the potassium channel and is accompanied by a set of curricular materials to facilitate app implementation during a discussion on membrane transport. The app is free to download on both {iOS} and Android systems, is suitable for use on mobile and tablet systems, and is aimed for target audiences ranging from introductory to advanced undergraduate levels.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction is a challenging and unsolved problem in computer science. Proteins are the sequence of amino acids connected together by single peptide bond. The combinations of the twenty primary amino acids are the constituents of all proteins. In-vitro laboratory methods used in this problem are very time-consuming, cost-intensive, and failure-prone. Thus, alternative computational methods come into play. The protein structure prediction problem is to ﬁnd the three-dimensional native structure of a protein, from its amino acid sequence. The native structure of a protein has the minimum free energy possible and arguably determines the function of the protein. In this study, we present the preliminaries of proteins and their structures, protein structure prediction problem, and protein models. We also give a brief overview on experimental and computational methods used in protein structure prediction. This study will provide a fundamental knowledge to the computer scientists who are intending to pursue their future research on protein structure prediction problem.},

More recently, the advent of greater accessibility to virtual reality ({VR}) and augmented reality ({AR}) programs has created a new mechanism to visualize biomolecules. However, creation of {VR} and {AR} programs often requires extensive coding experience. In order to expand the utility of {AR} programs in visualization of biomolecules, we enabled undergraduate students to create their own {AR} protein visualization tool using an oﬀ-the-shelf program running in multiplatform smartphones or tablets to enhance student inclusivity. Assessment of this program shows that students can create their own biomolecule models, were enthusiastic about doing so, and found that their learning was enhanced when this {AR} module was inserted into their upper level biochemistry class. This activity could be readily adapted for remote and online learning.},

            Past decades have seen much effort devoted to the tool development for biomacromolecule structural visualization and analysis. In recent years, we have witnessed tremendous advancement in computational technologies, especially in graphics and internet. Here we present an integrative cloud-based, virtual reality ({VR}) system -- {VRmol} that exploits these technology advances to visualize and study macromolecule structures in various forms. The immersive environment can improve user experiences in visualization, calculation, and editing of complex structures with more intuitive perception. {VRmol} is also a system with cloud-based capability to directly access disease-related databases, and couples the structure with genomic variation as well corresponding drugs information in a visual interface, thus serving as an integrative platform to aid structure-based translational research and drug design. {VRmol} is freely available at
