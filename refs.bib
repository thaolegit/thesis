One example is the ability to create enhanced 3D environments that simulate physical presence in the real worlda virtual reality. This is relevant to drug discovery since molecular models are frequently used to obtain deeper understandings of, say, ligand−protein complexes. We have developed a tool (Molecular Rift), which creates a virtual reality environment steered with hand movements. Oculus Rift, a head-mounted display, is used to create the virtual settings. The program is controlled by gesture-recognition, using the gaming sensor {MS} Kinect v2, eliminating the need for standard input devices. The Open Babel toolkit was integrated to provide access to powerful cheminformatics functions. Molecular Rift was developed with a focus on usability, including iterative test-group evaluations. We conclude with reﬂections on virtual reality’s future capabilities in chemistry and education. Molecular Rift is open source and can be downloaded from {GitHub}.},

The lack of simple, accessible, and easy-to-use teaching tools for visualizing and interacting with (i.e., rotating, translating, zooming) 3D virtual representations of macromolecular structure also continues to be a limitation for biochemistry instructors interested in incorporating more 3D visualizations in their classrooms. To address this current gap in available instructional tools, a novel app utilizing augmented reality ({AR}) technology to visualize macromolecular structures is described. The app allows users to easily visualize and manipulate the 3D structure of the potassium channel and is accompanied by a set of curricular materials to facilitate app implementation during a discussion on membrane transport. The app is free to download on both {iOS} and Android systems, is suitable for use on mobile and tablet systems, and is aimed for target audiences ranging from introductory to advanced undergraduate levels.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction is a challenging and unsolved problem in computer science. Proteins are the sequence of amino acids connected together by single peptide bond. The combinations of the twenty primary amino acids are the constituents of all proteins. In-vitro laboratory methods used in this problem are very time-consuming, cost-intensive, and failure-prone. Thus, alternative computational methods come into play. The protein structure prediction problem is to ﬁnd the three-dimensional native structure of a protein, from its amino acid sequence. The native structure of a protein has the minimum free energy possible and arguably determines the function of the protein. In this study, we present the preliminaries of proteins and their structures, protein structure prediction problem, and protein models. We also give a brief overview on experimental and computational methods used in protein structure prediction. This study will provide a fundamental knowledge to the computer scientists who are intending to pursue their future research on protein structure prediction problem.},

More recently, the advent of greater accessibility to virtual reality ({VR}) and augmented reality ({AR}) programs has created a new mechanism to visualize biomolecules. However, creation of {VR} and {AR} programs often requires extensive coding experience. In order to expand the utility of {AR} programs in visualization of biomolecules, we enabled undergraduate students to create their own {AR} protein visualization tool using an oﬀ-the-shelf program running in multiplatform smartphones or tablets to enhance student inclusivity. Assessment of this program shows that students can create their own biomolecule models, were enthusiastic about doing so, and found that their learning was enhanced when this {AR} module was inserted into their upper level biochemistry class. This activity could be readily adapted for remote and online learning.},

            Past decades have seen much effort devoted to the tool development for biomacromolecule structural visualization and analysis. In recent years, we have witnessed tremendous advancement in computational technologies, especially in graphics and internet. Here we present an integrative cloud-based, virtual reality ({VR}) system -- {VRmol} that exploits these technology advances to visualize and study macromolecule structures in various forms. The immersive environment can improve user experiences in visualization, calculation, and editing of complex structures with more intuitive perception. {VRmol} is also a system with cloud-based capability to directly access disease-related databases, and couples the structure with genomic variation as well corresponding drugs information in a visual interface, thus serving as an integrative platform to aid structure-based translational research and drug design. {VRmol} is freely available at

	abstract = {The propagation of augmented reality ({AR}) and virtual reality ({VR}) applications that leverage smartphone technology has increased along with the ubiquity of smartphone adoption. Although {AR} and {VR} technologies have been widely utilized in the educational domain, there remains a dearth of empirical research examining the differences in educational impact across {AR} and {VR} technologies. The purpose of our exploratory study was to address this gap in the literature by comparing {AR} and {VR} technologies with regard to their impact on learning outcomes, such as retention of science information. Specifically, we use a two-condition ({AR} vs. {VR}) between-subjects' design to test college students' science-knowledge retention in response to both auditory and visual information presented on a Samsung S4 smartphone app. Our results (N = 109) suggest that {VR} is more immersive and engaging through the mechanism of spatial presence. However, {AR} seems to be a more effective medium for conveying auditory information through the pathway of spatial presence, possibly because of increased cognitive demands associated with immersive experiences. Thus, an important implication for design is that educational content should be integrated into visual modalities when the experience will be consumed in {VR}, but into auditory modalities when it will be consumed in {AR}.},

Although {ARGBL} has the potential to enable new forms of teaching and transform the learning experience, it remains unclear how {ARGBL} applications can impact students’ motivation, achievements, and learning performance. This study reports a systematic review of the literature on {ARGBL} approaches in compulsory education considering the advantages, disadvantages, instructional affordances, and/or effectiveness of {ARGBL} across various primary and secondary education subjects. In total, 21 studies published between 2012 and 2017 in 11 indexed journals were analysed, with 14 studies focusing on primary education and 7 on secondary. The main findings from this review provide the current state of the art research in {ARGBL} in compulsory education. Trends and the vision towards the future are also discussed, as {ARGBL} can potentially influence the students’ attendance, knowledge transfer, skill acquisition, hands-on digital experience, and positive attitude towards their learning. This review aims to lay the groundwork for educators, technology developers, and other stakeholders involved in the development of literacy programmes for young children by offering new insights with effective advice and suggestions on how to increase student motivation and improve learning outcomes and the learning experience by incorporating {ARGBL} into their teaching.},

This review found that most augmented reality applications for {STEM} learning offered exploration or simulation activities. The applications reviewed offered a number of similar design features based on digital knowledge discovery mechanisms to consume information through the interaction with digital elements. However, few studies provided students with assistance in carrying out learning activities. Most of the studies reviewed evaluated the effects of augmented reality technology in fostering students' conceptual understanding, followed by those that investigated affective learning outcomes. A number of suggestions for future research arose from this review. Researchers need to design features that allow students to acquire basic competences related with {STEM} disciplines, and future applications need to include metacognitive scaffolding and experimental support for inquiry-based learning activities. Finally, it would be useful to explore how augmented reality learning activities can be part of blended instructional strategies such as the flipped classroom.},

	abstract = {Understanding protein structures is a crucial step in creating molecular insight for researchers as well as students and pupils. The enormous scaling gap between an atomic point of view and objects in daily life hampers developing an intuitive relation between them. Especially for high school students, it can be difficult to understand the spatial relations of a protein structure. Due to lack of direct imaging techniques, molecules can only be explored by studying abstract molecular models. Here, the use of Augmented reality ({AR}) techniques has proven to strongly improve structural perception. In this work we present {ProteinScanAR}, an augmented reality framework for biomolecular education that allows connecting virtual and real worlds intuitively, and thus enables focusing on the scientific or educational content. Special attention was taken to guarantee implementational and technical requirements as general and simple as possible to alleviate application in nonexpert computer settings.

Although {AR} is frequently applied in educational environments, the value of {AR} applications in these environments is not yet investigated in its entirety. Additionally, educators face different directions of {AR} applications, which may differ regarding their potential benefits. To help overcome these challenges, we conduct a systematic literature review to synthesize a set of 25 publications. We identify 14 different benefits and cluster these into six different groups. We use the Five Directions of {AR} in educational environments by Yuen et al. [1] to further detail possible benefits for different directions of {AR} applications. Our findings indicate that specific directions of {AR} applications are more likely to lead to certain benefits such as increased motivation. Future research is needed to investigate the causality between benefits and directions of {AR} in more detail.},

	abstract = {An antagonistic relationship is traditionally seen as existing between eco-education and technology, with conventional instructional approaches usually characterized by a commentator guiding students in field learning. Unfortunately, in this passive learning approach, the discovery of rich ecological resources in eco-environments to stimulate positive emotions and experiences is often condensed into a “sightseeing”. Therefore, precise and systematic guidance focused on providing a rich learning experience is needed in field learning and eco-education. Based on Kolb's experiential learning theory, the current study develops an eco-discovery {AR}-based learning model ({EDALM}) which is implemented in an eco-discovery {AR}-based learning system ({EDALS}). In a field experiment at a botanical garden, 21 middle school students constitute three groups participated in a learning activity using different learning types and media. Quantitative results indicate that, compared to the human-guidance-only model, {EDALS} successfully stimulates positive emotions and improved learning outcomes among learners. In post-activity interviews, students indicated they found the exploration mode provided by the proposed system to be more interesting and helpful to their learning in school. The use of attractive technologies increase students' willingness not only to learn more about the environment, but also to develop a more positive emotional attachment to it.},

	abstract = {The chemical reaction between different molecules is an important learning subject in a chemistry course. Especially for elementary school students, this can be an abstract concept and therefore difficult to understand. One way to facilitate this learning process is to use Augmented Reality ({AR}) technology, which is considered as an added value compared with classical learning materials such as textbooks, two-dimensional images, video, and so forth. Among the different advantages of using {AR} technology in the context of the educational domain is the fact that three-dimensional technology is offering a safe environment especially if the students have to perform critical tasks such as simulating chemical reactions. This work investigates students' attitude toward the use of a mobile {AR} application for learning atoms' and molecules' reactions. In particular, we focused on female students because, in general, female students show less interest in science and technology than male students. We were keen to investigate whether the use of {AR} technology could change this attitude. The students are able to interact with different {AR} components to explore the possible reactions in a three-dimensional interface, to understand the structure and shape of atoms and molecules, and to view related explanations in their native language, that is, the Arabic language. The mobile {AR} application was evaluated by a class of 12- to 13-year-old (7th grade) students in a Palestinian primary school. The number of participants was 50, all female students. After analyzing the results, we can conclude that these female students had a positive attitude toward the use of this {AR} application in their learning process.},

	doi = {10.1109/IV.2012.97},
	abstract = {Understanding protein structures is a crucial step in creating molecular insight for researchers as well as students and pupils. The enormous scaling gap between an atomic point of view and objects in daily life hampers developing an intuitive relation between them. Especially for high school students, it can be difficult to understand the spatial relations of a protein structure. Due to lack of direct imaging techniques, molecules can only be explored by studying abstract molecular models. Here, the use of Augmented reality ({AR}) techniques has proven to strongly improve structural perception. In this work we present {ProteinScanAR}, an augmented reality framework for biomolecular education that allows connecting virtual and real worlds intuitively, and thus enables focusing on the scientific or educational content. Special attention was taken to guarantee implementational and technical requirements as general and simple as possible to alleviate application in nonexpert computer settings. The {ProteinScanAR} framework is freely available under the {GNU} Public License ({GPL}).},

	abstract = {Spatial reasoning is defined as the ability to generate, retain, and manipulate abstract visual images. In chemistry, spatial reasoning skills are typically taught using 2-D paper-based models, 3-D handheld models, and computerized models. These models are designed to aid student learning by integrating information from the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains of chemistry. Research has shown that increased spatial reasoning abilities translate directly to improved content knowledge. The recent explosion in the popularity of smartphones and the development of augmented reality apps for them provide, a yet to be explored, way of teaching spatial reasoning skills to chemistry students. Augmented reality apps can use the camera on a smartphone to turn 2-D paper-based molecular models into 3-D models the user can manipulate. This paper will discuss the development, implementation, and assessment of an augmented reality app that transforms 2-D molecular representations into interactive 3-D structures.},
