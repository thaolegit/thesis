	shorttitle = {Molecular Rift},
	abstract = {Recent advances in interaction design have created new ways to use computers. One example is the ability to create enhanced 3D environments that simulate physical presence in the real worlda virtual reality. This is relevant to drug discovery since molecular models are frequently used to obtain deeper understandings of, say, ligand−protein complexes. We have developed a tool (Molecular Rift), which creates a virtual reality environment steered with hand movements. Oculus Rift, a head-mounted display, is used to create the virtual settings. The program is controlled by gesture-recognition, using the gaming sensor {MS} Kinect v2, eliminating the need for standard input devices. The Open Babel toolkit was integrated to provide access to powerful cheminformatics functions. Molecular Rift was developed with a focus on usability, including iterative test-group evaluations. We conclude with reﬂections on virtual reality’s future capabilities in chemistry and education. Molecular Rift is open source and can be downloaded from {GitHub}.},
